//Introduction: callbacks

// A callback function is a function that is passed into another function as an argument and 
// is intended to be executed after some kind of event or operation. Callback functions are 
// widely used in JavaScript, especially for handling asynchronous operations such as interactions 
// with a web server, timers, event handling, or any operations that require waiting for 
// something to complete before proceeding.
