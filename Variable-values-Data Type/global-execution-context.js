//whenever the a SCRIPT FILE  is created the js create

//this is big box with 2 phase that is 1.one memory allocation phase 

//in memory allocation the js perform the concept of the hositing 
//2second phase is called the code execution phase 

// in this js replace the undefined value with actual value 
//2.1 in the code excution phase the js engine it will again create functional execution context 
//in this 2 part 2.1.1 memory allocation phase and 2.1.2 code execution part 
//that is for each function there will be separete functional part 
//but there will only one global execution context 

//inside the GEC it will create the functional execution conetxt for each function
