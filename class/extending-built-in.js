// Built-in classes like Array, Map and others are extendable also.

// For instance, here PowerArray inherits from the native Array:


// add one more method to it (can do more)
class PowerArray extends Array {
    isEmpty() {
      return this.length === 0;
    }
  }
  
  let arr = new PowerArray(1, 2, 5, 10, 50);
  alert(arr.isEmpty()); // false
  
  let filteredArr = arr.filter(item => item >= 10);
  alert(filteredArr); // 10, 50
  alert(filteredArr.isEmpty()); // false



//   No static inheritance in built-ins

//   Built-in objects have their own static methods, for instance Object.keys, Array.isArray etc.
  
//   As we already know, native classes extend each other. For instance, Array extends Object.
  
//   Normally, when one class extends another, both static and non-static methods are inherited. 
//   That was thoroughly explained in the article Static properties and methods.
  
//   But built-in classes are an exception. They donâ€™t inherit statics from each other.
